Coding challenge part 9

Assume you want to build two functions for discounting products on a website.
Function number 1 is for student discount which discounts the current price to 10%.
Function number 2 is for additional discount for regular buyers which discounts an additional 5% on the current student discounted price.
Depending on the situation, we want to be able to apply both the discounts on the products.


sln:-

def student_discount(price):
    price = price - (price * 10) / 100
    return price
 
def additional_discount(newprice):
    newprice = newprice - (newprice * 5) / 100
    return newprice
 
selling_price = 100
 
#applying both discounts simultaneously
 
print(additional_discount(student_discount(selling_price)))
