Coding challenge 



Write a function which would divide two numbers, design the function in a manner that it handles the divide by zero exception.

Solution:-

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a/b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("There is a divide by zero error")
        return 0

x = float(input("Enter a number"))
y = float(input("Enter value by which u want to divide"))
result = divide(x, y)
print(result)
